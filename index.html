                        While Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea series as a whole is some of the best written fantasy in the genre, my personal favorite is the first book, <em>A Wizard of Earthsea</em>. <em>A Wizard of Earthsea</em> follows Ged, who discovers he has magic abilities at an early age. He enters a school for young wizards where his temptation to use forbidden powers causes a rupture which follows him in a journey through the world and through&nbsp;explorations&nbsp;within&nbsp;himself.

                    <p>
                        Le Guin has a talent for world building that makes you feel the rich history of the islands of Earthsea. Her simple but effective prose evokes the feelings of mystery and adventure, the sights and sounds of lonesome voyages and epic battles on Ged's journey. At around 200 pages <em>A Wizard of Earthsea</em> is a quick and easy read, accessible and entertaining to adult and young&nbsp;adult&nbsp;readers&nbsp;alike.

                        <em>Let the Right One In</em> is a horror novel written by Swedish author John Ajvide Lindqvist. Called the "Swedish Stephen King", Lindqvist excels at compelling, heartfelt moments between characters in a backdrop of supernatural terror. <em>Let the Right One In</em> centers on Oskar, a pre-teen dealing with troubles in his family and disturbing harrassment at school. When Oskar befriends Eli, a strange new girl in his apartment complex, he is thrown into a dark series of events that entangles many characters and stories in the town of Blackeberg.

                    <p>
                        Let the Right One In strikes the perfect balance between examinations of relationships, the different forms of love that bond them, and thrilling fast paced horror. It also has perhaps the most cathartic ending I have ever read. It is so fun and easy that I reread it before Halloween every year. Give it a try this October for maximum spooky vibes!

                        Legendary author Shirley Jackson is one of the most beloved writers in the horror genre, and while The Haunting of Hill House is her most popular work, <em>We Have Always Lived in the Castle</em> is the weirder and more interesting of the two. Narrator Merricat Blackwood lives in a dilapidated mansion with her older sister and bizarre uncle. From the perspective of Merricat's thoughts, we experience her unsettling view of the world and a delusional and unreliable interpretation of events. A mistrustful town, an unexpected visitor, and a dark secret make this story compelling from start to finish.

                        Considered one of the great American novels, <em>Call of the Wild</em> tells the timeless tale of deep seated desire to return to a more natural and primal state of being. When Buck is stolen away from his comfortable California life he is set on an adventure through the frozen Yukon territory of Canada. Forced to learn the ways of the sled dog, Buck follows his ferocious drive to break from the reigns of domestication and feel the true power of his wild spirit.

                        Jack London perfectly captures the magic and terror of escape from civilization, making <em>Call of the Wild</em> ubiquitous in the English lexicon. A must read for all ages.

                        By far the weirdest book on my list is <em>House of Leaves</em> by Mark Z. Danielewski. Considered a modern classic of the post-modern genre, House of Leaves constructs an unnerving web of narratives that will perplex and mystify even advanced readers. Through many layers of journal entries, movie reviews, and private letters, it tells the story of a family who discovers their new Virginia home is much larger and darker inside than they could have imagined.

                    <p>
                        The varying forms and writing styles of <em>House of Leaves</em> makes it a dazzling read, though not for the faint of heart. However determined readers will come out on the other side with a newfound understanding of the breadth and possibilities of what fiction writing can achieve.
